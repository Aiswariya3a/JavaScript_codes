# ðŸ“˜ JavaScript Learning Tracker

Welcome to my daily JavaScript learning journey! This README helps keep track of the topics Iâ€™ve covered each day.

## âœ… Day 1 â€“ JavaScript Basics

### ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

- **`<script>` Tag**
  - Embedding JavaScript in HTML using the `<script>` tag.
  - External scripts with `src` attribute.

- **JavaScript Code Structure**
  - JavaScript statements are syntax constructs that perform actions.
  - You can write multiple statements in your script.
  - Statements are **usually** separated by semicolons (`;`), but in many cases, JavaScript automatically inserts semicolons where line breaks occur (called *automatic semicolon insertion*).
  - However, there are exceptions where line breaks donâ€™t count as semicolons.
  - It's recommended to **always use semicolons** to avoid unexpected behavior.

- **Modern Mode â€“ `"use strict"`**
  - Introduced with ECMAScript 5 (ES5) in 2009.
  - `"use strict"` is a special directive that enables modern, stricter parsing and error handling.
  - It must be placed at the top of the script or at the beginning of a function.
  - Helps catch errors and disables outdated or error-prone features.
  - Once enabled, it cannot be turned off within the script.

- **Variables in JavaScript**
  - `let`, `const`, and `var` declarations.
  - Naming conventions and best practices.

- **Data Types in JavaScript**
  - 7 primitive types: `number`, `bigint`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`
  - 1 non-primitive type: `object`
  - Usage of `typeof` operator.

- **User Interaction**
  - `alert(message)` â€“ Shows a simple message.
  - `prompt(message, default)` â€“ Asks the user for input.
  - `confirm(message)` â€“ Requests confirmation from the user.
