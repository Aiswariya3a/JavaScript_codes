    <title>OR Operator</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    The “OR” operator is represented with two vertical line symbols.<br />
    It works with boolean only, If an operand is not a boolean, it is converted
    to a boolean for the evaluation.<br />
    If any of its arguments are true, it returns true, otherwise it returns
    false.<br />
    <br />
    true || true => true<br />
    false || true => true<br />
    true || false => true<br />
    false || false => false<br />
    <br />
    Given multiple OR'ed values, It evaluates operands from left to right.<br />
    For each operand, converts it to boolean. <br />
    If the result is <b>true</b>, stops and returns the
    <b>original value of that operand</b>(returns the first true value).<br />
    If all were <b>false</b>, returns the <b>last operand</b>.<br /><br />
    Another feature of OR || operator is “short-circuit” evaluation => It means
    srgumants are processed until the first truthy value is reached, and then
    the value is returned immediately, without even touching the other
    argument.<br />

  <script>
    let hour = 12;
    let isWeekend = true;

    if (hour < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) {
      //each condition returns boolean, which is testified
      alert("The office is closed."); // it is the weekend
    }

    let firstName = "";
    let lastName = "";
    let nickName = "SuperCoder";

    alert(firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // SuperCoder, nickname=SuperCoder is first truthy value.

    alert(undefined || null || 0); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)

    //short-circuit evaluation
    true || alert("not printed");
    false || alert("printed");
