    Historically, the language attribute was used to indicate the scripting language being used (e.g., language="javascript").
    However, it then considered obsolete. The recommended approach those days is to use the type attribute with the value text/javascript for JavaScript code.
    The old HTML standard, HTML4, required a script to have a type. Usually it was type="text/javascript". 
    It is not required anymore.

<script type="text/javascript">
    alert("Modern HTML standard changed the meaning of this attribute. Now, it can be used for JavaScript modules.");
