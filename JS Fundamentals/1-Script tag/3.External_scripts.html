    <title>External Scripts</title>
</head>
<body>
    If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file. Multiple script files can be attached to HTML with the src attribute. We can give a full URL as well.
    <h1>Why External?</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.</li>
    <li>The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.</li>
    <li>Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.</li>
    <li>That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.</li>
    </ul>
