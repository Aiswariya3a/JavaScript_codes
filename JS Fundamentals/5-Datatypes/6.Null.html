    <title>The “null” value and The “undefined” value</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The special "null value" and "undefined value" does not belong to any of
      the types. They make a type of its own<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Null</h2>
    <p>
      It is just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value
      unknown”.
    </p>
    <h2>Undefined</h2>
    <p>
      The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.<br />
      If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined<br>
      Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign undefined to a variable
