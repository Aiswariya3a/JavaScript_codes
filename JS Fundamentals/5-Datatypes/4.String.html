    <p>A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.</p>
    <p>
      Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There is practically no
      difference between them in JavaScript. <br />
      Backticks (`) are “extended functionality” quotes. <br />
      They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping
      them in ${…}
    </p>

  <script>
    let str = "Hello";
    let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
    let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;
  </script>
