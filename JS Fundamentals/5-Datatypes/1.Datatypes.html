      We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one
      moment be a string and then store a number:
    </p>
    <p>
      // no error<br />
      let message = "hello";<br />
      message = 123456;<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are
      called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but
      variables are not bound to any of them.
