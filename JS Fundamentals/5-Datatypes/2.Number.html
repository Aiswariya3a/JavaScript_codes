  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.<br />
      Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values”
      which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>NaN</h2>
    <p>
      NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an
      undefined mathematical operation<br />
      NaN is sticky. Any further mathematical operation on NaN returns NaN<br />
      if there is a NaN somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to
      the whole result (one exception to that: NaN ** 0 is 1).<br>
      The script will never stop with a fatal error (“die”). At worst, we will get NaN as the result.
    </p>

  <script>
    alert(1 / 0); // Infinity or alert( Infinity );
    alert("not a number" / 2); // NaN, such division is erroneous
    //stick NaN
    alert(NaN + 1); // NaN
    alert(3 * NaN); // NaN
    alert("not a number" / 2 - 1); // NaN
  </script>
