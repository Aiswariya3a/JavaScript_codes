    <title>typeof operator</title>

  <body>
    <p>
      The typeof operator returns the type of the operand.<br />
      <b>Syntax</b><br />
      You may also come across another syntax: typeof(x). It is the same as
      typeof x.<br />
      typeof is an operator, not a function.<br />
      The parentheses here aren’t a part of typeof. <br />It’s the kind of
      parentheses used for mathematical grouping.
      <br />
      <b>Exception</b><br />
      The result of typeof null is "object". <br />
      That is an officially recognized error in typeof, coming from very early
      days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. <br />
      Definitely, null is not an object. It is a special value with a separate
      type of its own. <br />
      The behavior of typeof is wrong here.

  <script>
    typeof undefined; // "undefined"
    typeof 0; // "number"
    typeof 10n; // "bigint"
    typeof true; // "boolean"
    typeof "foo"; // "string"

    typeof Math; // "object"  (1) - Math is a built-in object that provides mathematical operations
    typeof null; // "object"  (2)
    typeof Symbol("id"); // "symbol"

    typeof alert; // "function"  - alert is a function
