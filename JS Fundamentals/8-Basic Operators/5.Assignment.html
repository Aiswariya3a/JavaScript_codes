    <title>Assignment operator</title>

  <body>
    <p>
      when we assign a variable, like x = 2 * 2 + 1, the calculations are done
      first and then the = is evaluated, storing the result in x. <br />
      '=' is an operator - All operators in JavaScript return a value - '='
      returns a value too.<br />
      <b
        >The call <em>x = value</em> writes the value into x and then returns
        it.</b
      >
    </p>
    <h2>Chaining assignments</h2>
    a = b = c = 2 + 2 is same as <br />
    c = 2 + 2;<br />
    b = c;<br />
    a = c;<br />
    Chained assignments evaluate from right to left.

  <script>
    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;

    let c = 3 - (a = b + 1); // first b+1 = (2)+1 = 3 then c=3-(a=3) then a=3 returns 3 so, c=3-3 then c=0

    alert(a); // 3
    alert(c); // 0
