  <body>
    <p>
      The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing
      them with a comma ,. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the
      last one is returned.<br />
      Mainly used in <b>'for'</b><br />
      The comma operator has very low precedence, lower than = <br />
      Without paranthesis:<br />
      a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4 evaluates + first <br />
      summing the numbers into a = 3, 7 <br />
      then the assignment operator = assigns a = 3, and the rest is ignored
      <br />
      It is like (a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4.
    </p>

  <script>
    let a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);

    alert(a); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)
  </script>
