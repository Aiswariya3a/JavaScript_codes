    <title>String concatenation</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) Strings.<br />
    if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a
    string too.<br />
    <br />
    alert(2 + 2 + '1' ) - returns "41" and not "221" <br />
    operators work one after another. The first + sums two numbers, so it
    returns 4, then the next + adds the string 1 to it, so it is like 4 + '1' =
    '41'.<br />
    alert('1' + 2 + 2) - returns "122" and not "14" <br />
    the first operand is a string, the compiler treats the other two operands as
    strings too.<br />
    The binary + is the only operator that supports strings in such a way. Other
    arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their
    operands to numbers.

    let s = "my" + "string";
    alert(s); // mystring

    alert("1" + 2); // "12"

    alert(6 - "2"); // 4, converts '2' to a number
    alert("6" / "2"); // 3, converts both operands to numbers
  </script>
