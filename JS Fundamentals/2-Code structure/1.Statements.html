    <h1>Statements</h1>
    <p>Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.<br>
    We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.</p>
    <h1>Semicolon</h1>
    <p>A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists. <br>
    Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.</p>
    <h2>Exceptions in implicit semicolon</h2>
    There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon.
    We recommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines. This rule is widely adopted by the community.

<script>
    // no semicolon, still works
    alert('Hello')
    alert('World');
