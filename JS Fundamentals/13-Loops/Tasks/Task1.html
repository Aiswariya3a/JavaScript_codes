  <body>
    <p>
      Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor
      enters another number - ask them to input again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number
      greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There's no need
      to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.
    </p>
  </body>
  <script>
    let num;
    do {
      num = prompt("Enter a number:", "");
    } while (num <= 100 && num); //If num is null then num <= 100 is true, so without the 2nd check the loop wouldnâ€™t stop if the user clicks CANCEL. Both checks are required.
  </script>
