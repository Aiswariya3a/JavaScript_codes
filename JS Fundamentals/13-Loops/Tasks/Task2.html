    <p>
      An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided
      without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can't be evenly divided by anything
      except 1 and n.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a
      remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.
    </p>
    <p>For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.</p>

    let n = prompt("Enter a number", "");
    next: for (i = 2; i < n; i++) {
      for (j = 2; j < i; j++) {
        if (i % j == 0) continue next; //if condition true, that number is not prime, move to next number
      }
      alert(i);
    }
