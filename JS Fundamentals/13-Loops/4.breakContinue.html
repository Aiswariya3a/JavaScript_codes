  <body>
    <h2>break</h2>
    <br />
    we can force the exit at any time using the special break directive.<br />
    The combination "infinite loop + break as needed" is great for situations
    when a loop's condition must be checked in the middle or even in several
    places of its body.
    <h2>Continue</h2>
    <br />
    continue stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one
    (if the condition allows).<br />

    <b>both cannot be used with the ternary operator ?.</b>This is just another
    reason not to use the question mark operator ? instead of if.

    //the loop below asks the user for a series of numbers, “breaking” when no number is entered
    let sum = 0;
    while (true) {
      let value = +prompt("Enter a number", "");
      if (!value) break; // (*)
      sum += value;
    }
    alert("Sum: " + sum);

    //The loop below uses continue to output only odd values
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      // if true, skip the remaining part of the body
      if (i % 2 == 0) continue;
      alert(i); // 1, then 3, 5, 7, 9
    }
