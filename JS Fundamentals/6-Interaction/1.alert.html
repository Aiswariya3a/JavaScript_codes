    It shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK”.<br />
    <p>
      The mini-window with the message is called a <b>modal window</b>.<br />
      The word “modal” means that the visitor can’t interact with the rest of
      the page or press other buttons, until they have dealt with the window.<br />
      In this case – until they press “OK”.
