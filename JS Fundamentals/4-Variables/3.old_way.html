    <title>Old way of assigning variable</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Normally, we need to define a variable before using it. But in the old
      times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere
      assignment of the value without using let. This still works now if we
      donâ€™t put use strict in our scripts to maintain compatibility with old
      scripts.
    </p>
    <p><b>This is a bad practice and would cause an error in strict mode</b></p>
  </body>
  <script>
    // note: no "use strict" in this example
    num = 5; // the variable "num" is created if it didn't exist
    alert(num); // 5
  </script>
