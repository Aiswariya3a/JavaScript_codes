# JavaScript Variables

## Summary

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. You can declare them using one of the following keywords:

- **`let`** – Modern way to declare variables. It allows block-scoped variables.
- **`var`** – Old-fashioned declaration method. Rarely used today, but still good to know for legacy code and specific cases.
- **`const`** – Like `let`, but the variable's value cannot be reassigned once set.

### Notes

- Prefer `let` and `const` in modern code.
- Use meaningful variable names that clearly describe the data they hold, making the code easier to read and maintain.

Example:

```javascript
let userName = "Aishu";
const birthYear = 2003;
