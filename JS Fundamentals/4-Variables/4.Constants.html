    <p>
      To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let<br />
      Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be
      reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error
    </p>
    <h2>Uppercase constants</h2>
    <p>
      There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for
      difficult-to-remember values that are known before execution.<br />

      Such constants are named using capital letters and underscores.<br />
      <b>
        capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded”
        values.
      </b>
