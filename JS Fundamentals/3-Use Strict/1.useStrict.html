    <p>2009, when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. It added new features to the language and modified some of the existing ones.<br>
    To keep the old code working, most such modifications are off by default.<br>
    You need to explicitly enable them with a special directive: "use strict".</p>
    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <p>The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. <br>
        When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.<br>
        "use strict" can be put at the beginning of a function. Doing that enables strict mode in that function only. But usually people use it for the whole script.</p>
        <p>There is no way to cancel use strict</p>
</body>
<script>
    "use strict";

// this code works the modern way
</script>
